# BnBrew

BnBrew is an AirBnb Clone that aims at trying to replicate the features and responsiveness of the famous rental application, AirBnb, with a bit of a twist. The main focus of BnBrew is to list out different breweries that people can go and visit. The users can see breweries owned by other users and the reputation they hold throughout the reviewing system. As well as create their own brewery spot to start advertising to others or tell about their experience on the breweries they loved and the ones that they did not so much.

##### Technologies used
* Express.js
* REACT 18
* Redux 4.2.1
* Sqlite3
* Sequelize

To launch the applicaiton and get your brewery adventure started just:
1. Start by cloning the repo.
2. Open the root folder and make sure to type "npm install" into your terminal
3. Now do the same step (type "npm install) but into both the frontend directory and the backend directory
4. Then make sure to have two terminals open, one in the frontend directory and the other in the backend
5. Type "npm start" into the backend to start your express server and then npm start into the front end to start your react server

> Make sure that if you want to close the application, that you end both of your servers by hitting 'ctrl + c' in both of your terminals
